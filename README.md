# Calculator Application - Tkinter Python

## Overview

This project is a simple **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Calculator** built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports advanced features like exponentiation, square roots, and toggling between positive and negative numbers. The layout is intuitive, replicating a traditional calculator interface, with buttons arranged for easy input.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Exponentiation**: Raise a number to a power or square it with dedicated buttons.
- **Square Root**: Easily compute the square root of a number.
- **Sign Toggle**: Switch between positive and negative numbers.
- **Clear/Backspace**: Options to clear all inputs or remove the last character.
- **Decimal Support**: Perform operations with decimal numbers.

## Interface Layout

The calculator's interface consists of:
- A large display area to show the current input or result.
- Buttons arranged in a grid, allowing users to input numbers, operations, and special functions like clear or backspace.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI toolkit, used to design the user interface.
- **Math Library**: For advanced calculations like square roots.
